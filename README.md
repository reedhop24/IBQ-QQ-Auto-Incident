# IBQ Quick Quote Field Handling

##### This is a small bit of code that I wrote for IBQ's Quick Quote platform. This project was built using JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, and Express. The QuickQuote UI is dependent on our back end to make GET's for the field's and the field's rules. Therefore in this small code base I am just making a GET to a local server that I have running and the server is returning JSON data which holds the information for populating the fields. I would ping to the actual UI but we have put a token system in place and I do not want to involve that process, therefore the data being returned is static JSON.

##### Once the data is received from the API I am checking whether it is of three types of input DATE, VARCHAR(length), ENUM(options). Dependent on the type of data I then append the HTML to the DOM. After it is appended, after each selection a user makes I am validating their selection against the rules that were returned from the API.
